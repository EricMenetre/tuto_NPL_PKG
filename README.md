# A tutorial for the NPL package

Here is a complete tutorial of how to use the NPL package. I will try to keep this updated, however, there might be a delay between the insertion of new functions in the NPL package and their description in the tutorial.

The tutoriel is under the form of a R markdown document. You can read it either in R directly or using the .html file.
